''' Addreses in our application will be generated as follows:

    - Final 31 bytes are the first 62 characters of a SHA-512 hash of the asset UUID.

    '''

    '''Another option is to delete a sale ALWAYS after someone has bought it, which might make sense.
    TODO: Still need to implement the creation of a new sale when the buyer does not buy all of the energy.
	IMPORTANT FROM THIS TODO ^^^: When you buy from someone you have 2 possibilities:
	1- Buy all of the sale: You create a buy transaction, create a buy state (with the amount sold and bought being the same and
		other fields, and finally you MODIFY the sale state, changing the amount to sell to 0.
	2- Buy some of the sale: You create a buy transaction, create a buy state (with the amount sold and bought and
		other fields, and finally you MODIFY the sale state, changing the amount to sell to the difference, so other
		participants can still buy it (The dates of creaton and validity stay the same, and all the transactions are recorded.
	Let's say for example, Prosumer A sells 100. Consumer B buys 10, so he creates a transaction of buy, sends to validator,
	transaction processor, this one makes a buy state, saying he had 100 and you bought 10, MODIFIES current sale state, changing
	the 100 to 90, end. Consumer C sees the system and 90 are on sale, decides to buy 50, same than with Consumer B, does
	the same and changes the sale state from 90 to 40 ...
